        - Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization
          of knowledge  (e.g as a record in a specific database, or an online digital
          resource). A RecordMetadata object can capture provenance and other metadata,
          including when, how, and by whom a specific record was generated or modified;
          what upstream resources it was derived/retrieved from; and record-level

        - The 'sourceRecordMeta' attribute holds a RecordMetadata object that carries
          information about a separate, upstream source record from which the present
          record derived its content.  This attribute is only used in edge cases where
          the data creator wants to caopture metadata about usptream source records.

    comments:
    - Information Entities represent the abstract 'information content' encoded in
      physical or digital artifacts such as books, photographs, files, web pages,
      the neural connections of a human brain, etc. They are independent of any specific
      language, representational format, or physical/digital medium. In the FRBR model,
      this corresponds to the 'Works' level of representation.

    comments:
    - In the VA model, each assertion of knowledge about a variant is captured in
      a self-contained Statement object. The semantics of what is asserted to be true
      is explicitly structured in terms of a subject, predicate, object, and qualifier(s).
      Organization of variant knowledge into discrete Statement objects allows clear
      and precise tracking of the evidence and provenance that supports each.

        comments:
        - The VA-Spec uses value sets to hold the types of relationships that may
          be described in a particular type of Statement. The core specification itself
          is domain agnostic, and does not define Codings for any specific types of
          relationships.  When applied to represent a particular type of Statement
          (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships
          relevant in the domain. For example, in a Statement about the pathogenicity
          of a variant, the predicate value set might include codings for 'pathogenic
          for', 'benign for', and 'uncertain significance for' relationships.

        comments:
        - The qualifier attribute allows representation of more complex, n-ary expressions
          that may not be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object triple.
          For example, if this triple asserts that 'Variant X' - predicts sensitivity
          to - 'Drug Y', a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in
          the context of a particular 'Disease Z'.  Qualifiers can also add information
          that 'quantifies' a Statement - e.g. for a Statement triple asserting that
          a 'Variant X'- causes - 'Phenotype Y', a qualifier can be used to add penetrance
          information that quantifies the percentage of carriers in which the phenotype

        - Along with the 'subject', predicate', 'object', and 'qualifier' attributes,
          the 'negated' element contributes to the semantics of what a Statement asserts

        - Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
          to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments
          have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate,
          weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example,
          ExaC allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant
          in different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument
          of moderate strength in support of a Proposition that the variant is pathogenicity
          for breast cancer.

        comments:
        - Evidence is any information that is interpreted in assessing the truth of  the
          proposition a Statement puts forth as true.  A piece of information only
          becomes evidence when it is interpreted in this way. Different types and
          scales of information entity can be used and cited as evidence, including
          direct observation or measurement data, derived statistical calculations,
          data tables or figures in a publication, conclusions/findings from a particular
          study, or prior assertions of knowledge  that themselves are based on their
          own set of evidence.  This is a shortcut relation that links a Statement
          directly to a piece of evidnece supporting it, to be used data creators
          cannot or do not wich to create an Evidence Line between them.

      evidence in curation workflows aimed at generating higher order knowledge about
      a particular variant or other entity. For example, a specific subset of allele

      dataset can be summarized in a Study Result object, and referenced as evidence
      for a higher-order Statement about the variant's pathogenicity that relied on

    comments:
    - 'Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information
      (Evidence Items) to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition
      (possible fact). The Evidence Line that results can be considered a special
      kind of Statement that asserts the direction and strength such an argument provides
      for some target Proposition. For example, The various allele counts and frequency
      calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant found in the ExAC database are
      Evidence Items  that might be collectively assessed by a ClinGen curator to
      build an Evidence Line that is deemed to ''support'' with ''moderate'' strength
      a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.  The
      narrative form of the Statement represented by this Evidence Line is roughly:
      "ExAC allele frequency data for BRCA2 c.8023A>G {0.0000021, 0.0000034, ...}
      provides evidence of moderate strength supporting the proposition that BRCA2
      c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer".'

        - A given Evidence Line might be suported by one or many individual pieces
          of evidence. Different types or scales of information entity can serve as
          evidence - but only when it realizes this role do we call it an 'Evidence
          Item'. For example, a piece of population frequency data about BRCA2 c.8023A>G  becomes
          an Evidence Item when it is assessed as evidence (e.g. for the variant’s
          pathogenicity - and thus contributes to an argument for (or against) this
          target proposition.

    title: Proposition
    comments:
    - Propositions are taken to represent the semantic content of sentences or larger
      lexical entities formulated in some natural or artificial language. As primary
      bearers of truth, they are either true or false. They are abstract entities
      whose identity and existence are independent of space and time, and of whether
      they are ever asserted to be true by some agent. Propositions are ‘sharable’
      in the sense that the same Proposition instance can be expressed in many different
      Statements, as made by different Agents and/or on different occasions.

        comments:
        - The VA Core model is domain-agnsotic, and supports Statements/Propositions
          about any tyep of Entity.  Typically this will be a genetic varition - but
          data creators may want to make Statements/Propositions about other entities
          that represent evidence for a Statement about variation (e.g. a statement
          that a gene is valid for some disease is one type of evidence that may support
          the pathogenicity of a variant that affects that gene).

        comments:
        - The VA-Spec uses value sets to hold the types of relationships that may
          be described in a particular type of Statement. The core specification itself
          is domain agnostic, and does not define Codings for any specific types of
          relationships.  When applied to represent a particular type of Proposition
          (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships
          relevant in the domain. For example, in a Proposition about the pathogenicity
          of a variant, the predicate value set might include codings for 'pathogenic
          for', 'benign for', and 'uncertain significance for' relationships.

        comments:
        - The object of a Proposition can be an Entity that describes or is related
          to the subject Variation (e.g. a Drug, a Genetic Condition, a Study Result),
          a Coding from a value set representing some concept in the domain of discourse,
          or some quantitative value about the Variation.  'Element' covers any type
          of element in the model.

          - e.g. by providing additional information/detail, or constraining the claim
          to apply in a particular context.
        comments:
        - Qualifiers allow representation of more complex, n-ary expressions that
          may not be accommodated by a simple S-P-O triple. For example, if a triple
          asserts that Variant X - is associated with sensitivity to - Drug Y, a qualifier
          can be used to indicate that this applies in the context of a particular
          treated Condition Z.

        comments:
        - Along with the 'subject', predicate', 'object', and 'qualifier' attributes,
          the 'negated' element contributes to the semantics of the 'possible fact'
          that a Proposition expresses.

      including when, how, and by whom a specific record was generated or modified;
      what upstream resources it was derived/retrieved from; and record-level administrative
      information such as versioning and system / lifecycle status.

    - A Genetic Condition object can be used to compose a condition description based
      on component diseases and phenotypes, contributing genes, and an inheritance
      pattern. For now it is a simple/loose collection of features.  We can define
      a more complex model to support more precise and nuanced characterizations,
      as needed in future iterations.

    - The string data type represents free-text that is not constrained to some code
      set or associated with some semantic interpretation. It is the most generic
      form of free-text literal in the model, and conceptually subsumes other string-based
      data types with more constrained interpretations (e.g. code, identifier, url).

    - This string must be the name of a concrete class from the core VA specification,
      or a specialization of such a class in a profile defined by a particular implementation.
      The ‘class’ data type described here is reserved for specifying the type of
      an object/instance in a dataset.

    title: dateTime
    comments:
    - Conventions for representing date + time defined here are based on the ISO 8601
      standard. Hours of the day should use 24-hour time (e.g. 2PM = 14:00:00). A
      time zone can be specified as described for ‘dates’ above, e.g. "1978-01-20T05:15:00Z,
      and "1978-01-20T05:15:00+5:00".  If precision down to time of day is not possible
      or necessary, the hours, minutes, and seconds must still be provided due to
      schema constraints, but can all be set to “00” and ignored at the instruction
      of the message sender.

    title: identifier
    comments:
    - We distinguish between two types of identifiers depending on their intended
      scope of use. ‘Logical identifiers’ are used to identify a data object within
      a given system, where it is used as a reference from other objects within the
      same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys). The same data object copied to
      a different system will likely have a different logical identifier in that new
      system. ‘Business identifiers’ are typically provided by an external system
      or authority, and are meant to be globally unique and persist across implementing
      systems. A given entity or concept may have many business identifiers associated
      with it, which can all be captured in a given data system. In the VA model,
      we follow FHIR naming conventions and use an  id  attribute to hold the logical
      identifier of a data object, and an identifier attribute to hold any business
      identifiers that the data creator may also want to provide. Use of the W3C Compact
      URI (CURIE) syntax to structure identifiers is strongly recommended, as a way
      to ensure that a given identifier is unique within its intended scope of use.
