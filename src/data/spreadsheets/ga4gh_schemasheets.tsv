GA4GH-VA-Spec	https://w3id.org/ga4gh-va	vaspec													
						Element		Element		FHIR:Element		The base definition for all elements that comprise the model (classes, complex data types, value sets) 			This class is useful to reference as the range of attributes that can take instances of a class or a complex data type (e.g. a Coding) as their value (e.g. Statement.object)
						Element					extensionElement	A key-value data structure that allows definition of custom fields to capture information not directly supported by the VA specification.	Extension	0..*	The VA-Spec provides  implementers the ability to extend any model elements with new attributes using this flexible Extension element.
						Entity	Element	Entity	Thing	BFO:0000001		Anything that exists, has existed, or will exist.			Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit its attributes.
						Entity				FHIR:id	localId	The logical identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID.  This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system.	identifier	1..1	FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where an 'id' field holds logical identifiers which are unique only within a given system, and an 'identifier' field holds business identifiers, which are globally unique and used to connect entities and share content across systems. 
						Entity				FHIR:identifier	globalIdentifier	A business identifier or accession number for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or authority, that is globally unique and persists across implementing systems.	identifier	0..*	FHIR naming conventions are followed here, where an 'id' field holds logical identifiers which are unique only within a given system, and an 'identifier' field holds business identifiers, which are globally unique and used to connect entities and share content across systems. 
						Entity					type	The schema class that is instantiated by the data object.  Must be the name of a class from the VA schema.	class	1..1	
						Entity					label	A primary name for the Entity.	string	0..1

						Entity					xref	A cross-reference to database identifier(s) representing the same or a closely related entity or concept as the Entity.	string 	0..*	Preferred values for this field are CURIEs or URLs for database records
						Entity					thisRecordMeta	A reusable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata about the present record/data object  (as opposed to provenance information about the real world entity this record/data object represents).	RecordMetadata	0..1	Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of knowledge  (e.g as a record in a specific database, or an online digital resource). A RecordMetadata object can capture provenance and other metadata, including when, how, and by whom a specific record was generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived/retrieved from; and record-level administrative information such as versioning and system / lifecycle status.
						Entity					sourceRecordMeta	A reusable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata that applies to an upstream record/data objdct about the Entity, from which content of the present record was derived. 	RecordMetadata	0..*	The 'sourceRecordMeta' attribute holds a RecordMetadata object that carries information about a separate, upstream source record from which the present record derived its content.  This attribute is only used in edge cases where the data creator wants to caopture metadata about usptream source records.
						InformationEntity	Entity	Information Entity	Information Content Entity, ICE	IAO:0000030 | FRBR:Work		An abstract (non-physical) entity that is about something.			Information Entities represent the abstract 'information content' encoded in physical or digital artifacts such as books, photographs, files, web pages, the neural connections of a human brain, etc. They are independent of any specific language, representational format, or physical/digital medium. In the FRBR model, this corresponds to the 'Works' level of representation. 
						InformationEntity					isAbout	An entity or concept in the world that the information entity describes/is about.	Entity	0..*	This field can be used to tag a Statement object with things it is about, in lieu of providing a more precise description of what the Statement asserts to be true using subject, predicate, object, and qualifier fields. 
						InformationEntity					qualifiedContribution	A specific contribution made by some Agent to the creation, modification, or validation of the information represented in the Information Entity.	Contribution	0..*	This attribute points to a Contribution object, which holds a structured description of the actions taken by a particular agent in contributing to an Information Entity.
						InformationEntity					dateAuthored	The date the information content expressed in this entity was generated.	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	We use the term 'authored' to refer to the generation of information in the abstract - i.e. the information content expressed in a Statement, not a concrete encoding of it in a specific language or format.  The 'dateAuthored' attribute captures when this abstract information content was first created.  Information about when a particular concrete encoding of this information was created (e.g. as a VA-based json object) would live in a RecordMetadata object attached to the Information Entity).
						InformationEntity					wasSpecifiedBy	A plan specification that describes all or part of the process through which the information was generated.  	Method	0..*	Depending on the type of plan spcification, these may be called 'protocols', 'guidelines', 'methods', 'rule sets', etc.

						InformationEntity					partOf	A larger Information Entity of which the present Information Entity is a part.	InformationEntity	0..*	
						InformationEntity					isReportedIn	A document in which the information content carried by the Information Entity is expressed	Document	0..*	This attribute is used specifically to reference documents/publications where the Information Entity is expressed or reported.  For a Statement, this might be a publication where the authors express the statement in text.  For a Data Item, this might be a publication with a table or figure that reports the value of the  data.   Note that the VA-Spec provide separate attributes for describing different types of 'references' from an Information Entity to a Document (e.g. hasEvidenceFromSource is used by a Statement to reference a Document that provided evidence for the knowldege the Statement expresses.
						InformationEntity					confidenceLevel	A qualitative term describing the degree of confidence held by the creator of the information entity, that the information it represents is true (e.g. 'high confidence', 'likely true', 'low confidence').	Coding	0..1	What a confidence level or score reflects may vary depending on the type of InformationEntity it describes. For Statements, it may reflect an agent's confidence that the statement asserts a proposition that is true. For a DataItem, its may reflect an agent's confidence that the value is an accurate reflection of the reality it measures or describes. For an Image, this may reflect the agent's confidence that it accurately represents the subject it depicts. 
						InformationEntity					confidenceScore	A quantitative score reflecting the degree of confidence held by the creator of the information entity, that the information it represents is true.	DataItem	0..1	
						InformationEntity					version	The version of the Information Entity (to be used in cases where version is not reflected in the id or identifiers associated with the entity).	string	0..1	Note that this attribute captures the version of the abstract information content that comproses the Information Entity - in cases where updated versions of the entity are released.  Versioning of specific concrete records/encodings of the information in a particular format/syntax are to be captured in the recordVersion field of a RecordMeadata object associated with the Information Entity.
						InformationEntity					license	The type of license that dictates legal permissions for how a resource (e.g. dataset, document, protocol) can be used - typically referenced by its URL.	string	0..1	
						DataItem	InformationEntity	Data Item		IAO:0000027		An InformationEntity representing an individual piece of data, generated/acquired through methods which reliably produce truthful information about something.			Examples include raw observations or measurements such as an allele count, or patient's weight, derived calculations such as frequency or mean, and computed statistical scores/metrics such as p-values and z-scores.
						DataItem					dataItemType	A specific type of data the DataItem object represents (e.g. a specimen count, a patient weight, an allele frequency, a p-value)	Coding	0..*	
						DataItem					value	The value of the data item	string	1..1	
						DataItem					unit	A unit of measure for the value	Coding	0..1	
						DataItem					variability	A score describing the variability inherent in a data item representing a statistical summary of a set of observations/measurements (e.g. the standard deviation associated with a statistical mean calculated across several experimental replicates).	DataItem	0..*	Examples of statistical measures of variability include an Interquartile Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Standard Error. 
						DataItem					confidenceInterval	A measure of the probability that a parameter of interest will fall within a defined range of values around a mean or other statistical calculation.	DataItem	0..1	Confidence intervals reflect the degree of uncertainty in a sampling method. They may be bounded on one or both sides, and are  computed for a designated confidence level (most often 95% or 99%.  Example: A Hazard Ratio of 0.47 might have a 95% confidence interval between 0.34 and 0.65, wiht a p-value of = 0.001.
						DataItem					componentDataItem	A more foundational data item that is a logical component of a compound data item.	DataItem	0..*	Examples of 'compound' data items with componet parts include a confidence interval, which is comprised of data items representing its lower and upper bounds, and a blood pressure reading, which is comprised of separate systolic and diastolic measurements.
						DataSet	InformationEntity	Data Set		IAO:0000100		A collection of related data items or records that are organized together in a common format or structure, to enable their computational manipulation as a unit.			Examples include the Broad ExAC dataset on allele population frequency, or a SIFT dataset of computational predictions functional impact for a set of variants, or the contents of a VCF file that describes variations observed in a particular patient and various annotations made on them. 
						DataSet					dataSetType	A specific type of data set the DataSet object represents.	Coding	0..*	The recorded type is typically based on the nature of the data in the dataset, and what it describes (e.g. genomic sequence dataset, genome feature annotation dataset) .
						DataSet					dataSetLevel	The level at which the Data Set is considered and described ('Summary' level, 'Version' level, or 'Distribution' level - see https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/#datasetdescriptionlevels)	Coding	0..1	The VA model adopts the W3C HCLS DataSet Model view that DataSets can be considered and described at three levels: - The 'Summary' level considers the Data Set at the most abstract/general level, independent of a specific version or format. - The 'Version' level considers a specific version of a Data Set, which may acquire version-specific characteristics (e.g. a release date). - The 'Distribution' level considers a specific format/encoding of a dataset version, which may acquire distribution-specific characteristics (e.g. a format, or downloadURL). Attributes defined for the DataSet class may apply at all or only some of the ‘levels’ described above. Guidance in this regard is provided in comments on each attribute, and should be followed when creating DataSet objects. 
						DataSet					releaseDate	The date when a version-level Data Set was released.	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	This attribute may apply to version and distribution-level Data Set representations.
						DataSet					license	The type of license that dictates legal permissions for how the Data Set can be used - typically referenced by its URL.	string	0..1	The VA Model can record license information for resources such as Data Sets and Documents that get published and released as a unit for community use. This attribute may apply to summary, version, and distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						DataSet					version	The version of the Data Set (use this field used in cases where version is not reflected in an identifier associated with the Data Set)	string	0..1	The VA Model can record version information for resources such as Data Sets and Documents that get published and released as a unit for community use. These may go through rounds of revisions that add or modify content, but don’t change the identity of the resource.  This attribute may apply to version and distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						DataSet					previousVersion	A version-level Data Set representing the version described here. 	DataSet	0..1	This attribute may apply to version and distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						DataSet					currentVersion	A version-level Data Set representing the most current version at the time of recording.	DataSet	0..1	This attribute may apply to version and distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						DataSet					format	A specific representational format used to encode a distribution-level Dataset. 	string	0..1	This attribute may apply to  distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						DataSet					conformsTo	A community standard that is used in representing any of the data in the Data Set (e.g. an ontology or code system from which enumerated values are drawn, a standard data model used to structure the representation).	string	0..*	This attribute may apply to summary, version, and distribution-level Data Set representations. 
						Document	InformationEntity	Document		IAO:0000310		A collection of information, usually in human-readable form, intended to be read and understood together as a whole.			
						Document					documentType	The specific type of the document (e.g.  'publication', 'patent', 'pathology report')	Coding	0..*	
						Document					title	The given title of the document.	string	0..1	
						Document					license	The type of license that dictates legal permissions for how the Document can be used - typically referenced by its URL.	string	0..1	The VA Model can record license information for resources such as Data Sets and Documents that get published and released as a unit for community use.
						Document					version	The version of the Document (use this field used in cases where version is not reflected in an identifier associated with the Document)	string	0..1	The VA Model can record version information for resources such as Data Sets and Documents that get published and released as a unit for community use. These may go through rounds of revisions that add or modify content, but don’t change the identity of the resource. 
						Statement	InformationEntity	Statement	Assertion; Claim	SEPIO:0000174		An information entity expressing a declarative sentence that is either true or false.			In the VA model, each assertion of knowledge about a variant is captured in a self-contained Statement object. The semantics of what is asserted to be true is explicitly structured in terms of a subject, predicate, object, and qualifier(s). Organization of variant knowledge into discrete Statement objects allows clear and precise tracking of the evidence and provenance that supports each.
						Statement					statementType	A specific type of statement the Statement object represents (e.g. a 'Variant Pathogenicity Statement', or 'Molecular Consequence Statement')	Coding	0..*	
						Statement					subject	The Entity about which the Statement is made.	Entity	1..1	The VA Core model is domain-agnsotic, and supports Statements/Propositions about any tyep of Entity.  Typically this will be a genetic varition - but data creators may want to make Statements/Propositions about other entities that represent evidence for a Statement about variation (e.g. a statement that a gene is valid for some disease is one type of evidence that may support the pathogenicity of a variant that affects that gene).
						Statement					predicate	The relationship asserted to hold between the subject and the object of the Statement.	Coding	1..1	The VA-Spec uses value sets to hold the types of relationships that may be described in a particular type of Statement. The core specification itself is domain agnostic, and does not define Codings for any specific types of relationships.  When applied to represent a particular type of Statement (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships relevant in the domain. For example, in a Statement about the pathogenicity of a variant, the predicate value set might include codings for 'pathogenic for', 'benign for', and 'uncertain significance for' relationships.
						Statement					object	An Entity, concept, or value that is related to the subject of a Statement via its predicate.	Element	1..1	The object of a Statement can be an Entity that describes or is related to the subject Variation (e.g. a Drug, a Genetic Condition, a Study Result), a Coding from a value set representing some concept in the domain of discourse, or some quantitative value about the Variation.  'Element' covers any type of element in the model.
						Statement					qualifier	A value or concept that extends or refines the meaning of the claim expressed in the core subject - predicate - object 'triple' - e.g. by providing additional information/detail, or constraining the claim to apply in a particular context.	Element	0..*	The qualifier attribute allows representation of more complex, n-ary expressions that may not be accommodated by a simple subject-predicate-object triple. For example, if this triple asserts that 'Variant X' - predicts sensitivity to - 'Drug Y', a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in the context of a particular 'Disease Z'.  Qualifiers can also add information that 'quantifies' a Statement - e.g. for a Statement triple asserting that a 'Variant X'- causes - 'Phenotype Y', a qualifier can be used to add penetrance information that quantifies the percentage of carriers in which the phenotype is observed to manifest.
						Statement					negated	A boolean flag set to 'true' if the statement expressed by the subject, predicate, object, and qualifier(s) is explicitly asserted to be false.	boolean	0..1	Along with the 'subject', predicate', 'object', and 'qualifier' attributes, the 'negated' element contributes to the semantics of what a Statement asserts to be true.  Accordingly, it would get encapsulsted in a Proposition object with these other other attributes in a Proposition-based approach.
						Statement					assertedProposition	The possible fact (proposition) that the Statement puts forth as true.	Proposition	0..1	This attribute provides the option of representing the semantics of what a Statement asserts to be true (its 'proposition') in a separate 'Proposition' object.  With this alternative modeling pattern, the subject, predicate, object, and any qualifier attributes are encapsulated inside a separate Proposition object. This Proposition can be referenced from from a Statements that assert it to be true, or an Evidence Line that weighs evidence against it).
						Statement					evidenceLevel	A term indicating the overall strength of support for the Statement based on all evidence assessed.	Coding	0..1	
						Statement					evidenceScore	A quantitative score reflecting the overall strength of support for the Statement based on all evidence assessed.	DataItem	0..1	
						Statement					hasEvidenceLine	A discrete, independent argument relevant to the validity of the Proposition put forth as true in the Statement, that is based on the interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence.	EvidenceLine	0..*	Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition. These arguments have direction (supporting / disputing) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) relative to the Proposition they are evaluated against. For example, ExaC allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant in different populations may be collectively assessed to provide an argument of moderate strength in support of a Proposition that the variant is pathogenicity for breast cancer.
						Statement					hasEvidence	A piece of information that represents or contributes to an argument for or against the validity of a Statement.	InformationEntity	0..*	Evidence is any information that is interpreted in assessing the truth of  the proposition a Statement puts forth as true.  A piece of information only becomes evidence when it is interpreted in this way. Different types and scales of information entity can be used and cited as evidence, including direct observation or measurement data, derived statistical calculations, data tables or figures in a publication, conclusions/findings from a particular study, or prior assertions of knowledge  that themselves are based on their own set of evidence.  This is a shortcut relation that links a Statement directly to a piece of evidnece supporting it, to be used data creators cannot or do not wich to create an Evidence Line between them.
						Statement					hasEvidenceOfType	A term describing a type of evidence used to support a Statement (e.g. 'sequence similarity evidence', 'in vitro assay evidence') - as opposed to an instance of evidence information such as a particular data item, study result, or prior assertions, etc.	Coding	0..*	The VA-Spec recommends the use of terms from ontologies such as the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) to describe specific types of evidence. 
						Statement					hasEvidenceFromSource	An Information Entity (typically a publication, dataset, or database) that reports information interpreted as evidence to make the Statement.	InformationEntity	0..*	This is a 'shortcut relation' that can be used to directly link a Statement to sources that provided evidence supporting/disputing it, without having to represent those Evidence Items directly. 
						Statement					subjectDescriptor	A collection of additional metadata about the subject of the Statement's proposition, that cannot represented in its value object based representation, but may be useful for understanding and use of the subject entity (e.g. labels, xrefs, aliases, and other subjective/context specific information)	Descriptor	0..1	See the VRSATILE Value Object Descriptor Specification for more detail about this modeling approach: https://vrsatile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/value_object_descriptor/index.html
						Statement					objectDescriptor	A collection of additional metadata about the object of the Statement's proposition, that cannot represented in its value object based representation, but may be useful for understanding and use of the subject entity (e.g. labels, xrefs, aliases, and other subjective/context specific information)	Descriptor	0..1	See the VRSATILE Value Object Descriptor Specification for more detail about this modeling approach: https://vrsatile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/value_object_descriptor/index.html
						Statement					qualifierDescriptor	A collection of additional metadata about an entity/concept that qualifies the Statement's proposition. This additional metadata cannot represented in its value object based representation, but may be useful for understanding and use of the subject entity (e.g. labels, xrefs, aliases, and other subjective/context specific information)	Descriptor	0..*	See the VRSATILE Value Object Descriptor Specification for more detail about this modeling approach: https://vrsatile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/value_object_descriptor/index.html
						StudyResult	InformationEntity	Study Result				 A collection of select data items from a single study that are about a particular subject or experimental unit -  and may include provenance metadata describing how these data were generated.			StudyResult objects end up being a very flexible and useful way to summarize the salient data/metadata from a larger study that is specifically useful as evidence in curation workflows aimed at generating higher order knowledge about a particular variant or other entity. For example, a specific subset of allele frequency data/metadata concerning a particular variant of interest in the Gnomad dataset can be summarized in a Study Result object, and referenced as evidence for a higher-order Statement about the variant's pathogenicity that relied on this frequency data for support. 
						StudyResult					studyResultType	A specific type of result the StudyResult object represents (e.g. an 'Allele Frequency Study Result')	Coding	0..*	
						StudyResult					focus	The specific subject, concept, or experimental unit in the Research Study that data in the Result is about. The focus guides the selection of data that is included within a single Study Result object.	Entity	0..*	The value of this field explains why the sleected data as included in the Study Result - because it all pertains to the 'focus' of the curator when creating it.  
						StudyResult					data	A piece of data from the source Study that is included in the Result, and pertains to the entity that is the 'focus'. Can be data directly about the focus, or metadata relevant to how this data was generated.	DataItem	0..*	
						StudyResult					interpretation	A qualitative interpretation of the lower-level data item(s) included in the result (e.g. that a result is high, normal, or low). 	Coding	0..1	This field allows basic interpretations / classifications to be included in a Study Result, such as binning a result as in or out of normal range.
						StudyResult					sourceDataSet	A larger Data Set from which the content of the Result was derived.	DataSet	0..*	
						StudyResult					sourceStudy	The Study that generated the date reported in the Result.	ResearchStudy	0..1	
						StudyResult					sourceStudyType	The type of study that produced the result (e.g. 'allele population frequency study', 'computational functional impact prediction', 'protein functional assay', 'randomized clinical trial')	Coding	0..1	This is a shortcut relationship that can be used to capture the type of source study in models that don't represent the Study itself as an object in the data. 
						StudyResult					sourceStudyDate	The date the study from which the Result was derived was performed.	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	This is a shortcut relationship that can be used to capture the date of the source study in models that don't represent the Study itself as an object in the data. 
						StudyResult					sourceStudyMethod	A plan specification that describes all or part of the process that created the information (e.g. interpretation guidelines, rule sets, etc.).	Method	0..*	This is a shortcut relationship that can be used to capture methods applied in the source study in models that don't represent the Study itself as an object in the data. 
						EvidenceLine	InformationEntity	Evidence Line		SEPIO:0000002		A discrete, independent argument relevant to the validity of the Proposition put forth as true in the Statement,  that is based on the interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence.			Evidence Lines result from the interpretation of one or more pieces of information (Evidence Items) to build an argument for or against a particular Proposition (possible fact). The Evidence Line that results can be considered a special kind of Statement that asserts the direction and strength such an argument provides for some target Proposition. For example, The various allele counts and frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant found in the ExAC database are Evidence Items  that might be collectively assessed by a ClinGen curator to build an Evidence Line that is deemed to 'support' with 'moderate' strength a target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.  The narrative form of the Statement represented by this Evidence Line is roughly: "ExAC allele frequency data for BRCA2 c.8023A>G {0.0000021, 0.0000034, ...} provides evidence of moderate strength supporting the proposition that BRCA2 c.8023A>G is pathogenic for Breast Cancer".
						EvidenceLine					evidenceLineType	A specific type of evidence the EvidenceLine object represents (e.g. 'mutant phenotype evidence', 'evidence from manual interpretation', 'ACMG PM2 evidence')	Coding	0..*	Data creators may choose to define specific types of evidence lines relevant for their domain/use case, based on the type of evidence items that comprise it, the methodology that guided evidence interpretation, or the type of statement the evidence line supports.  Terms from ontologies like the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) can be used as values here. 
						EvidenceLine					targetProposition	The proposition against which the evidence items were evaluated, in determining the overall strength and direction of evidence they provide (as captured in the Evidence Line)	Proposition	0..1	An example based on the ACMG Guidelines for germline variant pathogenicity interpretation: consider a curator assessing the evidence provided by population frequency data for a specific variant based on the ACMG criteria.  In order to assign a strength (e.g. moderate, strong) and direction (PM2 or  BS1) to this data as evidence, there must be some 'target proposition' toward which the evidence is assessed. If the PM2 criteria is deemed 'met', this indicates that the population frequency evidence supports with moderate strength the target proposition that the variant is pathogenic for the disease of interest. 
						EvidenceLine					hasEvidenceItem	An Information Entity that was evaluated in making the argument represented by the Evidence Lines.	InformationEntity	0..*	A given Evidence Line might be suported by one or many individual pieces of evidence. Different types or scales of information entity can serve as evidence - but only when it realizes this role do we call it an 'Evidence Item'. For example, a piece of population frequency data about BRCA2 c.8023A>G  becomes an Evidence Item when it is assessed as evidence (e.g. for the variant’s pathogenicity - and thus contributes to an argument for (or against) this target proposition.
						EvidenceLine					evidenceDirection	The direction of support that the Evidence Line is determined to provide for its target Proposition (can be supporting, disputing, or neutral)	Coding	0..1	
						EvidenceLine					evidenceStrength	The strength of support that an Evidence Line is determined to provide for or against its target Proposition.	Coding	0..1	
						EvidenceLine					evidenceItemSource	An information resource (e.g. document, dataset, knowledgebase) that provided information interpreted as evidence in building an Evidence Line.	InformationEntity	0..*	This is a 'shortcut relation' that can be used to directly link an Evidence Line to sources of its supporting Evidence Items, without having to represent those Evidence Items directly. 
						Method	InformationEntity	Method		IAO:0000104		A set of instructions that specify how to achieve some objective (e.g. study/experimental protocols, curation guidelines, rule sets, etc.)			Methods guide human or computational agents by specifying what actions to perform and how to do so.  Examples include research protocols specifying how to execute studies or experiments to generate data, and guidelines for data curation or interpretation that specify how information can be organized, evaluated, and interpreted to generate evidence-based assertions.
						Method					methodType	A specific type of method that the Method object represents (e.g. 'Variant Interpretation Guideline', 'Experimental Protocol')	Coding	0..*	
						Activity	Entity	Activity		PROV:Activity | OBI:0000011		An action or set of actions performed by an agent, that occurs over a period of time. Activities may use, generate, modify, move, or destroy one or more entities.  			Activities relevant to scientific knowledge generation including things like designing and performing experiments, data analysis and transfomration, publishing research results, data curation and interpretation, observations of the natural world, and assessment and treatment of patients in clinical settings.  These activities produce information that gets encoded in sharable artifacts used to generate scientific knowledge. Agents can play different types of roles in the generation and use of such artifacts.
						Activity					activityType	A specific type of activity this Activity object may represent	Coding	0..*	
						Activity					startDate	The date that the Activity started	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	The model provides startDate and endDate attributes to allow precise reporting of the time an Activity occurred. Implementations wishing to specify a single time should simply report the date and/or time that the contribution ended. An empty startDate means that the start time is unknown or unspecified.
						Activity					endDate	The date that the Activity ended	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	
						Activity					performedBy	An Agent taking part in executing the Activity.	Agent	0..*	
						Activity					hadInput	An entity that was input into the Activity (could be material or information)	Entity	0..*	
						Activity					hadOutput	An entity that was output from the Activity (could be material or information)	Entity	0..*	
						Activity					wasSpecifiedBy	A directive specification followed in performing an Activity, that describes how it should be executed. 	Method	0..*	
						Activity					hasPart	A smaller, discrete Activity that is part of this larger Activity	Activity	0..*	
						Activity					partOf	A larger Activity of which this Activity is a part (i.e. it was performed during the larger Activity)	Activity	0..*	
						ResearchStudy	Activity	Research Study		SEPIO:0000125		An activity that applies a defined methodological approach to interrogate a specific set of subjects, and generate data that is analyzed and interpreted to answer a particular research question (typically the validation or generation of hypothesis)                                			This is a stub for a basic model of a Study that will be developed in future iterations of the specification.  At present, adopters can plug their own model of research studies in here. 
						ResearchStudy	Activity				researchStudyType	A specific type of study this ResearchStudy object represents.	Coding	0..*	
						Contribution	Activity	Contribution		CAM:Contribution		The actions taken by a particular agent in the creation, modification, assessment, or deprecation of some entity (e.g. a Statement, Evidence Line, Data Item, Publication, etc.)			The scope of a given Contribution instance includes only the actions of a single agent in contributing to a single artifact.  The agent can be an individual, or a group or organization of individuals acting together to make the contribution. Contribution instances are used to organize information about when, where, how (e.g. what roles were played), and on whose behalf these actions were performed.
						Contribution					contributionMadeBy	The agent that made the contribution.	Agent	0..1	
						Contribution					contributionMadeTo	The artifact toward which the contribution was made.	InformationEntity	0..1	
						Contribution					contributorRole	A role indicating the nature of the contribution made by the Agent - i.e. the specific type of contribution that was made.	Coding	0..*	Data creators can define terms for the specific roles relevant to their use case/application, and/or re-use roles defined in the Contribution Role Ontology (CRO).  Note that if the same Agent played multiple roles in contibuting to some artifact, they may all be captured in a single Contribution object. However, if data creators want to provide metadata specific to each role (e.g. when or how each role was played), then a separate Contribution object should be created for each role.
						Contribution					organizationalContext	An organization whose resources and/or directives supported the contribution made by an Agent.	Affiliation	0..*	The Affiliation object holds details about an Agent's status/position in a particular Organization on whose behalf they were acting when they made the Contribution.
						Agent	Entity	Agent		CAM:Agent		An autonomous actor (person, organization, or computational agent) that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent’s activity.			This is a stub for a basic model of an Agent that may be developed in future iterations of the specification.  At present, adopters can plug their own model of Agents in here. 
						Agent					agentType	A specific type of agent the Agent object represents. Must be one of {Person, Organization, Software Agent}	Coding	0..1	At present, there are no named subtypes representing the three high level subtypes of Agent (Person, Organization, or Software Agent). If it is determined that there are enough unique properties that need to be defined for these subtypes, separate classes may be created. 
						Agent					softwareVersion	For software/computational agents, the specific version of the software it represents. 	string	0..1	
						Agent					hasAffiliation	A membership relation between the Agent and an Organization to which they belong or at one time belonged.	Affiliation	0..*	
						Agent					parentOrganization	A larger Organization of which this Organization is a part	Agent	0..*	The agentType of the referenced Agent should be set to 'Organization'
						Agent					childOrganization	A smaller Organization that is a part of this larger one	Agent	0..*	The agentType of the referenced Agent should be set to 'Organization'
						Proposition	Entity	Proposition		SEPIO:0000000		An abstract entity representing the sharable meaning that can be put forth as true in a Statement made by an Agent. 			Propositions are taken to represent the semantic content of sentences or larger lexical entities formulated in some natural or artificial language. As primary bearers of truth, they are either true or false. They are abstract entities whose identity and existence are independent of space and time, and of whether they are ever asserted to be true by some agent. Propositions are ‘sharable’ in the sense that the same Proposition instance can be expressed in many different Statements, as made by different Agents and/or on different occasions.
						Proposition					propositionType	A specific type of proposition the Proposition object represents (e.g. a 'Variant Pathogenicity Proposition', or 'Molecular Consequence Proposition')	Coding	0..*	
						Proposition					subject	The Entity about which the Proposition is made.	Entity	1..1	The VA Core model is domain-agnostic, and supports statements about any type of Entity.  For most VA use cases, the subject will be a genetic variation - but data creators may want to make statements about other entities that represent evidence for a Statement about variation (e.g. a statement that a gene is valid for some disease is one type of evidence that may support the pathogenicity of a variant that affects that gene).
						Proposition					predicate	The relationship asserted to hold between the subject and the object of the Proposition.	Coding	1..1	The VA-Spec uses value sets to hold the types of relationships that may be described in a particular type of Statement. The core specification itself is domain agnostic, and does not define Codings for any specific types of relationships.  When applied to represent a particular type of Proposition (via 'Profiling'), implementers can define predicates for the relationships relevant in the domain. For example, in a Proposition concerning the pathogenicity of a variant, the predicate value set might include codings for 'pathogenic for', 'benign for', and 'uncertain significance for' relationships.
						Proposition					object	An Entity, concept, or value that is related to the subject of a Proposition via its predicate.	Element	1..1	The object of a Proposition can be an Entity that describes or is related to the subject Variation (e.g. a Drug, a Genetic Condition, a Study Result), a Coding from a value set representing some concept in the domain of discourse, or some quantitative value about the Variation.  'Element' covers any type of element in the model.
						Proposition					qualifier	A value or concept that extends or refines the meaning of the Proposition expressed by the core subject - predicate - object 'triple' - e.g. by providing additional information/detail, or constraining the claim to apply in a particular context. 	Element	0..*	Qualifiers allow representation of more complex, n-ary expressions that may not be accommodated by a simple S-P-O triple. For example, if a triple asserts that Variant X - is associated with sensitivity to - Drug Y, a qualifier can be used to indicate that this applies in the context of a particular treated Condition Z.
						Proposition					negated	A boolean flag set to 'true' if the statement expressed by the subject, predicate, object, and qualifier(s) is explicitly asserted to be false.	boolean	0..1	Along with the 'subject', predicate', 'object', and 'qualifier' attributes, the 'negated' element contributes to the semantics of the 'possible fact' that a Proposition expresses.  
						Affiliation	Entity	Affiliation				A relationship between an Agent and a Group or Organization to which they belong or belonged.			
						Affiliation					member	The Agent participating in the Affiliation	Agent	1..1	The Affiliation object is scoped to define the relationship between one Agent and one Organization, over a specified period of time.  A given Agent may participate in more than on Affiliation with the same Organization, if they held different roles/positions/statuses at different times.
						Affiliation					organization	The Organization to which the Agent belongs or belonged.	Agent	1..1	Here the Agent referenced should be an Organization (Agent.agentType = 'Organization')
						Affiliation					organizationalRole	An official position or role held by the Agent in the Organization during the span of the defined Affiliation (e.g. graduate student, principle investigator, curator, physician, expert panel member)	Coding	0..*	
						Affiliation					affiliationStatus	The status of the Agent's affiliation at the time the Affiliation record was created  or last updated (e.g. active, pending, probation, inactive)	Coding	0..1	
						Affiliation					startDate	The date that the Affiliation described here began (where a organizational role is provided, this is the date when this role in the organization began)	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	If a specific organizational role and/or status are reported, the startDate indicates when this particular role/status began.  
						Affiliation					endDate	The date that the Affiliation described here ended (where a organizational role is provided, this is the date when this role in the organization ended)	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	If a specific organizational role and/or status are reported, the endDate indicates when this particular role/status ended.  
						Descriptor	Entity	Descriptor				An object that wraps a value object in order to transfer additional, non-definitional information about it.  			Value Object Descriptors are constructs created and used for message passing, and provide a means to separate immutable elements that define an entity, from other descriptors that are often passed along to improve the useability of the object (e.g. labels, identifiers, xrefs, aliases, etc.).
						Descriptor					valueObjectId	The computed identifier of the value object described/wrapped by the Descriptor	identifier	0..1	Condition:  either the valueObjectId or the valueObject field is Required
						Descriptor					valueObject	An in-lined representation of the wrapped value object	Entity	0..1	Condition:  either the valueObjectId or the valueObject field is Required
						Descriptor					valueObjectName	The preferred name for the wrapped value object as assigned by the creator of the VOD 	string	0..1	
						Descriptor					valueObjectAlias	Other labels that exist for the wrapped value object.  	string	0..*	Guidance: The primary purpose of this field is to capture simple, informal names. Labels based on systematically-generated expressions from formal nomenclatures can be included here, but are best captured using the valueObjectExpression field.
						Descriptor					valueObjectExpression	Systematic expressions that describe the wrapped object, as generated by formal nomenclature systems (e.g. HGVS, ISCN, HLA).	Expression	0..*	Guidance:  For Variations, itis strongly recommended that a HGVS or ISCN expression is captured in this field (even if it is the same as the preferred or an alias).
						Descriptor					valueObjectDescription	A free text description of the entity represented by the wrapped value object.	string	0..1	
						Descriptor					valueObjectXref	Points to an external database record for an entity that is equivalent to or closely related to the entity represented by the wrapped value object.	string	0..*	
						VariationDescriptor	Descriptor	Variation Descriptor				A Descriptor that describes a value object representation of a molecular variation. 			
						VariationDescriptor					moleculeContext	The type of macromolecule on which the variation exists (e.g. genomic, transcript, protein)	Coding 	0..1	
						VariationDescriptor					structuralType	The high-level structural type of the Variation (e.g. SNV, CNV, insertion, duplication, etc)	Coding	0..*	
						Coding	Element	Coding		FHIR:Coding		A structured representation of a coded/enumerated data value, that includes additional metadata about the code and code system.                                			
						Coding					code	The value of the code itself.	string	0..1	Either a code, label, or both must be provided. 
						Coding					label	A human-readable name for the code.	string	0..1	Either a code, label, or both must be provided. 
						Coding					system	The code system where the code is defined.	string	0..1	
						Coding					systemURL	A URL where the code system can be found.	url	0..1	
						Coding					systemVersion	The version of the code system.	string	0..1	
						Expression	Element	Expression				A structure for labels representing systematic expressions that describe an entity, as generated by formal nomenclatures (e.g. HGVS for genetic variants, ISCN for karyotypes, HLA nomenclature for HLA genes/alleles).			Similar to the 'Coding' data type, which provides the same fields but for coded values, as opposed to human-readable names.
						Expression					value	A free-text rendering of the expression used as a label for the entity	string	1..1	
						Expression					system	The nomenclature system that created and assigned the expression.	string	1..1	This should be provided whenever the expression comes from a formal nomenclature system.
						Expression					systemURL	A URL for the nomenclature system	url	0..1	
						Expression					systemVersion	The version of the nomenclature system.	string	0..1	
						Extension	Element	Extension		FHIR.Extension		A data structure that allows implementations to define and create custom fields within an Entity to capture information not supported by the core specification. 			The modeling pattern and use of Extensions is based on that defined by the FHIR Speciufication - see https://build.fhir.org/extensibility.html
						Extension					description	A free text description of the intended semantics and use of this extension element (i.e. they types of values it takes, and how to interpret these values in the context of the parent Class)	string	0..1	
						Extension					name	A name that captures the meaning of the extension element	string	1..1	
						Extension					value	The value of the extension element	Element	1..1	
						RecordMetadata	Element	Record Metadata				A re-usable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata that applies to a specific concrete record/encoding of information, as opposed to provenance of the abstract information content/knowledge the record represents.    			Record-level metadata applies to a specific concrete encoding/serialization of knowledge  (e.g as a record in a specific database, or an online digital resource). A RecordMetadata object can capture provenance and other metadata, including when, how, and by whom a specific record was generated or modified; what upstream resources it was derived/retrieved from; and record-level administrative information such as versioning and system / lifecycle status.
						RecordMetadata					description 	A free text description of the RecordMetadata object.	string 	0..1	It be helpful to describe in free text what specific record the object describes, and the type of metadata it contains, to assist consumers in understanding/using this information.
						RecordMetadata					recordIdentifier	The business identifier of the record described in the RecordMetadata object (required when the record described is not the one in the present system)   	identifier	0..1	This is needed only when the RecordMetadata object describes an upstream source record, as opposed to the record in the present system, so it is clear what the metadata it contains is about.  e.g. when ClinGen ingests and transfroms ClinVar data, it wants to maintain a record of when the source ClinVar record was submitted and by whom.  A RecordMetadata object could be created that describes this upstream source recrod, including infromation about its submission to ClinVar.   
						RecordMetadata					partOfDataset	The dataset of which the described record is a part (releveant when the record described is not the one in the present system)   	DataSet	0..1	Can provide important context for understanding record-level metadata, in cases where it describes records from upstream datasets/systems.
						RecordMetadata					recordVersion	The version number of the record-level artifact the object describes	string 	0..1	
						RecordMetadata					previousVersion	The version of a record in the same system that the current record replaces/follows.	identifier	0..1	Value should be a string representing the identifier of the previous record. Consider renaming: 'previousRecord', 'replaces'
						RecordMetadata					dateRecordCreated	The date the record was initially created.	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	
						RecordMetadata					dateRecordLastModified	The date the record was last edited/updated/modified to its present concrete form.	ga4ghDateTime	0..1	
						RecordMetadata					qualifiedContribution	Links to a 'Contribution' object allowing richer representation of specific types of contributions made by an agent to the creation, modification, or administrative management of a record.	Contribution	0..*	
						RecordMetadata					recordURL	A web address where the entity is found or described.	url 	0..*	
						RecordMetadata					xref	A cross-reference linking to an identifier for an entity/record that represents the same or a closely related concepts or knowledge as the present record.	string 	0..*	Preferred values for this field are CURIEs or URLs for database records
						Variation 	Entity	Variation 				A representation of the state of one or more biomolecules.			This is a placeholder for the root class of the VRS hierarchy of Variation classes, which we will use to represent the subjects of Statements in the VA model. See https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/terms_and_model.html#variation
						GeneticCondition	Entity	Genetic Condition				A disease, or a set of one or more co-occurring phenotypes, controlled by genetic factors with a defined inheritance pattern.			A Genetic Condition object can be used to compose a condition description based on component diseases and phenotypes, contributing genes, and an inheritance pattern. For now it is a simple/loose collection of features.  We can define a more complex model to support more precise and nuanced characterizations, as needed in future iterations.  
						GeneticCondition					componentDisease	A disease that is manifest in the genetic condition	Coding	0..*	
						GeneticCondition					componentPhenotype	A phenotype that is manifest in the genetic condition	Coding	0..*	
						GeneticCondition					inheritancePattern	The pattern in which the condition is passed from one generation to the next.	Coding	0..1	
						GeneticCondition					contributingGene	Genes implicated in the condition	Gene	0..*	
						TherapeuticIntervention	Entity	Therapeutic Intervention				A type of treatment administered/prescribed to a patient to prevent, ameliorate, or cure a medical condition.			This class is meant to describe a higher level class/type of therapeutic intervention, which may be composed of one or more drugs, procedures, or therapeutic activities -  as opposed to a specific instance that occurs on specific occasions toward particular patients.
						TherapeuticIntervention					componentDrug 	A chemical or biological substance administered or consumed to alleviate or prevent a condition	Coding	0..*	
						TherapeuticIntervention					componentProcedure	A medical procedure underwent to alleviate or prevent a condition	Coding	0..*	
						TherapeuticIntervention					componentActivity	An activity participated in to alleviate or prevent a condition	Coding	0..*	
						TherapeuticIntervention					drugOperator	Allows specification of how the drugs captured in the drug field should be considered in relation to each other (e.g. co-treatment, sequential treatment, alternates) 	Coding	0..1	
						Gene 	Entity	Gene 				A region (or regions) that includes all of the sequence elements necessary to encode a functional transcript. A gene may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions.			
						Gene 					biotype	A classification of the gene according to the Ensembl Biotypes (e.g. Protein coding, ncRNA, Pseudogene, IG gene, etc). 	string	0..1	See http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html.
						Gene 					symbol	Abbreviated symbol for the gene (e.g. 'BRCA2', 'FGF8')	string	0..1	Use the 'label' attribute to hold the full name of the gene.
						Gene 					location	Location of the gene on a reference.	SequenceLocation	0..*	Use the VRS SequenceLocation class to describe the location of the gene.
						Gene 					strand	The strand on which the gene is located (positive, negative)	Coding	0..1	
						SequenceLocation	Entity	Sequence Location				A specified subsequence of a reference Sequence. The reference is typically a chromosome, transcript, or protein sequence.			This is a stub for a class defined by the VRS specification:  https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/terms_and_model.html?highlight=curie#sequencelocation 
			ga4ghString	string	xsd:string			ga4ghString				A sequence of Unicode characters			The ga4ghString data type represents free-text that is not constrained to some code set or associated with some semantic interpretation. It is the most generic form of free-text literal in the model, and conceptually subsumes other ga4ghString-based data types with more constrained interpretations (e.g. identifier, class, url).
			url	ga4ghString	xsd:string			url				A string representing a Uniform Resource Locator (RFC 1738), specifying a web address where a resource can be found or information about the resource discovered. 			Used in place of a plain string datatype when a resolvable web address for a resource is desired.  Common URL protocols are http{s}:, ftp:, mailto: and mllp:, though many others are defined.
			class	ga4ghString	xsd:string			class				A string representing a class in a VA model used to type an object in the data.			This string must be the name of a concrete class from the core VA specification (e.g. 'Statement'), or a specialization of such a class in a profile defined by a particular implementation (e.g. TherapeuticEfficacyStatement'). 
			ga4ghDateTime	ga4ghString	xsd:string			ga4ghDateTime				A string value that specifies a date and time of day comprised of a year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, following the form “YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss”			Conventions for representing date + time defined here are based on the ISO 8601 standard. Hours of the day should use 24-hour time (e.g. 2PM = 14:00:00). A time zone can be specified as described for ‘dates’ above, e.g. "1978-01-20T05:15:00Z, and "1978-01-20T05:15:00+5:00".  If precision down to time of day is not possible or necessary, the hours, minutes, and seconds must still be provided due to schema constraints, but can all be set to “00” and ignored at the instruction of the message sender.
			identifier	ga4ghString	xsd:string			identifier				A string value that uniquely identifies a specific instance of an object in a dataset or document. Identifiers should be persistent, machine-resolvable, and unique within their intended scope of use. 			We distinguish between two types of identifiers depending on their intended scope of use. ‘Logical identifiers’ are used to identify a data object within a given system, where it is used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys). The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different logical identifier in that new system. ‘Business identifiers’ are typically provided by an external system or authority, and are meant to be globally unique and persist across implementing systems. A given entity or concept may have many business identifiers associated with it, which can all be captured in a given data system. In the VA model, we follow FHIR naming conventions and use an  id  attribute to hold the logical identifier of a data object, and an identifier attribute to hold any business identifiers that the data creator may also want to provide. Use of the W3C Compact URI (CURIE) syntax to structure identifiers is strongly recommended, as a way to ensure that a given identifier is unique within its intended scope of use. 
			ga4ghBoolean	boolean	xsd:boolean			ga4ghBoolean				A binary data type that holds either a TRUE or FALSE value.
